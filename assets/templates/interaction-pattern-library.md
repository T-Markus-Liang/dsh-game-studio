# Interaction Pattern Library: [Game Title]

> **Status**: Draft | Stable | Under Revision
> **Author**: [ux-designer]
> **Last Updated**: [Date]
> **Version**: [1.0]
> **Engine**: [Godot 4.6 / Unity 6 / Unreal Engine 5]
> **UI Framework**: [Godot Control nodes / Unity UI Toolkit / Unreal UMG]
> **Related Documents**:
> - `design/art/art-bible.md` — visual standards (colors, typography, iconography)
> - `docs/accessibility-requirements.md` — accessibility commitments per feature
> - `docs/ux/ux-spec-[screen].md` — individual screen specs that reference patterns

> **Why this document exists**: Every UI screen spec should be able to say
> "uses Button (Primary) pattern" rather than re-specifying hover states,
> press animations, focus behavior, keyboard handling, and screen reader
> announcements from scratch. This library is the single source of truth for
> reusable interaction behaviors. When a screen spec references a pattern name,
> the programmer looks it up here. When the behavior changes, it changes here
> and applies everywhere.
>
> This is a living document. Patterns are added as new screens are designed —
> do not design a new interaction without checking here first. If a new pattern
> is needed, add it here (or propose it to the ux-designer) before writing the
> first screen spec that uses it.
>
> **Status definitions**:
> - **Draft**: Interaction specified but not yet implemented or validated
> - **Stable**: Implemented, tested, and validated in at least one shipped screen
> - **Deprecated**: Being phased out — existing uses will be migrated, do not use in new screens

## How to Use This Library

**If you are designing a screen**: Browse the Pattern Catalog Index below before
inventing new interactions. When a standard pattern fits, reference it by name
in the screen spec (e.g., "The confirm button uses Button (Primary) pattern").
When no existing pattern fits, propose a new one — document it here alongside
or before the screen spec that introduces it.

**If you are implementing a screen**: When a screen spec says "use [PatternName]
pattern," find it in this document for the complete specification. The
implementation notes section contains engine-specific guidance. The accessibility
section contains the requirements that are non-negotiable.

**If you are reviewing a screen spec**: Verify that all interactive elements
reference a pattern from this library or include their own full interaction
specification. "Standard button" or "the usual way" is not a valid reference.

**If you are updating a pattern**: Changing a Stable pattern affects every screen
that uses it. Before changing, audit all usages (search screen specs for the
pattern name), determine the impact, get approval from the ux-designer, and
update this document before or simultaneously with any implementation change.

> Add a row here every time a new pattern is added to this document.
> The "Used In" column is the usages audit trail — update it when new screens
> adopt the pattern.
